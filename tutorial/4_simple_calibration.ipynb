    "# Tutorial 4: Calibration of a point SUMMA simulation with Ostrich\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook outlines the initial work on interfacing Ostrich into the `pysumma` workflow. \n",
    "The basic workflow is similar to that of the other `pysumma` objects, with some initialization of an object, configuration, and finally a `run` call.\n",
    "Before digging in I'll describe at a high level detail how the `Ostrich` object works.\n",
    "The `Ostrich` object basically manages the initial state of the calibration and will write out all of the necessary files to actually run the calibration.\n",
    "It only is a very thin wrapper around a subprocess call out to `Ostrich` itself.\n",
    "The `Ostrich` program will begin by setting initial parameter values and runs SUMMA through `run_script.py`, which is written by the `Ostrich` object.\n",
    "This run script will also handle the updating of the SUMMA parameter datastructures and evaluating the run with several metrics which can be used as loss functions.\n",
    "So far I have implemented KGE, MAE, and RMSE as well as a number of other helper pieces that I'll explain later.\n",
    "\n",
    "As usual we will begin with some standard imports and configuration, along with loading in some data that we'll use to determine default parameters."

    "Hopefully in the future we can streamline this process while allowing for ease of customization, but for now consider the interface to be in flux.\n",
    "The first thing that needs to be set is some information about how to calculate the objective function at each calibration step.\n",
    "We do this with several pieces of information, first setting the observation data file and the calibration variables in both the simulated and observed datasets.\n",
    "Then, you can specify a simple function to convert the observed and simulated data to match.\n",
    "In our case the observed data simply needs to be multiplied by negative one.\n",
    "Functions of this sort (lambdas) are the only supported method of conversion for the moment, and should be self contained (AKA not making any external function calls.\n",
    "Finally, we say that we want to calibrate using root mean square error as our objective function and that we want to minimize it (or rather, that we don't want to maximize it).\n",
    "As said earlier, the `cost_function` can be set to one of `RMSE`, `MAE`, or `KGE` for the moment.\n",
    "If setting the `cost_function` to `KGE` then you probably want to set `maximize` to `True`."
